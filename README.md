TYPO3 CMS Backend Styleguide
============================

Presents all supported styles for TYPO3 backend modules.

This styleguide is work in progress. It is not part of and does not represent the official documentation, yet.
Styleguide extension currently brings own css definitions that need to be integrated into TYPO3 CMS step by step.

# Table of content

1. Typography
2. Tables
3. Forms
4. Buttons
5. FlashMessages
6. Helpers

Disclaimer: This styleguide does not look perfect - besides documentation the guide should also point out missing concepts and styles.
Therefore every imperfect style also is a todo for us. The solution should be included in the TYPO3 CMS core.
