# TYPO3 extension `styleguide`

This style guide is a showcase for many TYPO3 backend features that are useful
for developing your own extensions:

* A number of snippets showing how to use standard backend UI elements like
  tables, buttons, boxes or notifications.
* A large number of examples of backend edit forms, showing many features of the
  [TCA](https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-tca/main/en-us/).

It provides a backend module that hooks into the 'help' menu of the top toolbar
of the backend and can also create a page tree to show examples.

This extension is being developed close to core: Additions and deprecations of
TYPO3 core features used in this extension will be considered here in a timely
manner.
