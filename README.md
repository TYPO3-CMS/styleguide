# Legal
Disclaimer: This styleguide does not look perfect - besides documentation the guide should also point out missing concepts and styles.
Therefore every imperfect style also is a todo. The solution could be included in the TYPO3 CMS core at any stage.

This guide is highly inspired by Bootstrap, Zurb Foundation and Pattern Lab.
